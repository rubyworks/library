= RELEASE HISTORY

The Library gem is a spin-off of the Rolls gem. The Library class
is at the heart of Rolls, but is well defined enough to stand on its
own as a separate supporting package. By having it as a separate
project it becomes easier to focus on it's essential functionality
without having the implmentation distorted by the broader Roll System.

Changes:

* Spin-off from Rolls and release.
